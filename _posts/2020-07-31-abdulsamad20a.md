title: Hierarchical Decomposition of Nonlinear Dynamics and Control for System Identification
  and Policy Distillation
abstract: Control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics is a major challenge
  on the road to fully autonomous agents. Current trends in reinforcement learning
  (RL) focus on complex representations of dynamics and policies. Such approaches
  have yielded impressive results in solving a variety of hard control tasks. However,
  this new sophistication has come with the cost of an overall reduction in our ability
  to interpret the resulting policies from a classical perspective, and the need for
  extremely over-parameterized controllers. In this paper, we take inspiration from
  the control community and apply the principles of hybrid switching systems, in order
  to break down complex representations into simpler components. We exploit the rich
  representational power of probabilistic graphical models and derive a new expectation-maximization
  (EM) algorithm for learning a generative model and automatically decomposing nonlinear
  dynamics into stochastic switching linear dynamical systems. Moreover, we show how
  this framework of probabilistic switching models enables extracting hierarchies
  of Markovian and auto-regressive locally linear controllers from nonlinear experts
  in an imitation learning scenario.
