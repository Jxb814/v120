title: Robust Online Model Adaptation by Extended Kalman Filter with Exponential Moving
  Average and Dynamic Multi-Epoch Strategy
abstract: 'High fidelity behavior prediction of intelligent agents is critical in
  many applications. However, the prediction model trained on the training set may
  not generalize to the testing set due to domain shift and time variance. The challenge
  motivates the adoption of online adaptation algorithms to update prediction models
  in real-time to improve the prediction performance. Inspired by Extended Kalman
  Filter (EKF), this paper introduces a series of online adaptation methods, which
  are applicable to neural network-based models. A base adaptation algorithm Modified
  EKF with forgetting factor (MEKF_lambda) is introduced first, followed by exponential
  moving average filtering techniques. Then this paper introduces a dynamic multi-epoch
  update strategy to effectively utilize samples received in real time. With all these
  extensions, we propose a robust online adaptation algorithm: MEKF with Exponential
  Moving Average and Dynamic Multi-Epoch strategy (MEKF_EMA-DME). The proposed algorithm
  outperforms existing methods as demonstrated in experiments.'
