title: Learning Convex Optimization Control Policies
abstract: Many control policies used in applications compute the input or action by
  solving a convex optimization problem that depends on the current state and some
  parameters. Common examples of such convex optimization control policies (COCPs)
  include the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), convex model predictive control (MPC),
  and convex approximate dynamic programming (ADP) policies. These types of control
  policies are tuned by varying the parameters in the optimization problem, such as
  the LQR weights, to obtain good performance, judged by application-specific metrics.
  Tuning is often done by hand, or by simple methods such as a grid search. In this
  paper we propose a method to automate this process, by adjusting the parameters
  using an approximate gradient of the performance metric with respect to the parameters.
  Our method relies on recently developed methods that can efficiently evaluate the
  derivative of the solution of a convex program with respect to its parameters. A
  longer version of this paper, which illustrates our method on many examples, is
  available at https://web.stanford.edu/Â boyd/papers/learning_cocps.html.
