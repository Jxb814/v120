title: Learning Dynamical Systems with Side Information
abstract: "  We present a mathematical formalism and a computational framework for
  the problem of learning a dynamical system from noisy observations of a few trajectories
  and subject to side information (e.g., physical laws or contextual knowledge). We
  identify six classes of side information which can be imposed by semidefinite programming
  and that arise naturally in many applications. We demonstrate their value on two
  examples from epidemiology and physics.  Some density results on polynomial dynamical
  systems that either exactly or approximately satisfy side information are also presented. "
