title: Riccati updates for online linear quadratic control
abstract: We study an online setting of the linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control
  problem on a sequence of cost functions, where similar to classical online optimization,
  the future decisions are made by only knowing the cost in hindsight. We introduce
  a modified online Riccati update that under some boundedness assumptions, leads
  to logarithmic regret bounds, improving the best known square-root bound. In particular,
  for the scalar case we achieve the logarithmic regret without any boundedness assumption.
  As opposed to earlier work, proposed method does not rely on solving semi-definite
  programs at each stage.
