title: Data-Driven Distributed Predictive Control via Network Optimization
abstract: We consider a networked linear system where system matrices are unknown
  to the individual agents but sampled data is available to them.  We propose a data-driven
  method for designing a distributed linear-quadratic controller where agents learn
  a non-parametric system model from a single sample trajectory in which nodes can
  predict future trajectories using only data available to themselves and their neighbors.
  Based on this system representation, we propose a control scheme where a network
  optimization problem is solved in a receding horizon manner. We show that the proposed
  control scheme is stabilizing and validate our results through numerical experiments.
