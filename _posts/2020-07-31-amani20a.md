title: Regret Bound for Safe Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization
abstract: Many applications require a learner to make sequential decisions given uncertainty
  regarding both the system’s payoff function and safety constraints. When learning
  algorithms are used in safety-critical systems, it is paramount that the learner’s
  actions do not violate the safety constraints at any stage of the learning process.
  In this paper, we study a stochastic bandit optimization problem where the system’s
  unknown payoff and constraint functions are sampled from Gaussian Processes (GPs).
  We develop a safe variant of the proposed algorithm by Srinivas et al. (2010), GP-UCB,
  called SGP-UCB, with necessary modifications to respect safety constraints at every
  round. Our most important contribution is to derive the first sub-linear regret
  bounds for this problem.
