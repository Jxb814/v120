title: On the Robustness of Data-Driven Controllers for Linear Systems
abstract: This paper proposes a new framework and several results to quantify the
  performance of data-driven state-feedback controllers for linear systems against
  targeted perturbations of the training data. We focus on the case where subsets
  of the training data are randomly corrupted by an adversary, and derive lower and
  upper bounds for the stability of the closed-loop system with compromised controller
  as a function of the perturbation statistics, size of the training data, sensitivity
  of the data-driven algorithm to perturbation of the training data, and properties
  of the nominal closed-loop system. Our stability and convergence bounds are probabilistic
  in nature, and rely on a first-order approximation of the data-driven procedure
  that designs the state-feedback controller, which can be computed directly using
  the training data. We illustrate our findings via multiple numerical studies.
