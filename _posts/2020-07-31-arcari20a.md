title: Dual Stochastic MPC for Systems with Parametric and Structural Uncertainty
abstract: Designing controllers for systems affected by model uncertainty can prove
  to be a challenge, especially when seeking the optimal compromise between the conflicting
  goals of identification and control. This trade-off is explicitly taken into account
  in the dual control problem, for which the exact solution is provided by stochastic
  dynamic programming. Due to its computational intractability, we propose a sampling-based
  approximation for systems affected by both parametric and structural model uncertainty.
  The approach proposed in this paper separates the prediction horizon in a dual and
  an exploitation part. The dual part is formulated as a scenario tree that actively
  discriminates among a set of potential models while learning unknown parameters.
  In the exploitation part,  achieved information is fixed for each scenario, and
  open-loop control sequences are computed for the remainder of the horizon. As a
  result, we solve one optimization problem over a collection of control sequences
  for the entire horizon, explicitly considering the knowledge gained in each scenario,
  leading to a dual model predictive control formulation.
