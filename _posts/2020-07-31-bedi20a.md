title: Efficient Large-Scale Gaussian Process Bandits by Believing only Informative
  Actions
abstract: 'Bayesian optimization is a framework for global search via maximum a posteriori
  updates rather than simulated annealing, and has gained prominence in tuning the
  hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms and more broadly, in decision-making
  under uncertainty. In this work, we cast Bayesian optimization as a multi-armed
  bandit problem, where the payoff function is sampled from a Gaussian process (GP).
  Further, we focus on action selections via the GP upper confidence bound (UCB).
  While numerous prior works use GPs in bandit settings, they do not apply to settings
  where the total number of iterations $T$ may be large-scale, as the complexity of
  computing the posterior parameters scales cubically with the number of past observations.
  To circumvent this computational burden, we propose a simple statistical test: only
  incorporate an action into the GP posterior when its conditional entropy exceeds
  an $\epsilon$ threshold. Doing so permits us to derive sublinear regret bounds of
  GP bandit algorithms up to factors depending on the compression parameter $\epsilon$
  for both discrete and continuous action sets. Moreover, the complexity of the GP
  posterior remains provably finite. Experimentally, we observe state of the art accuracy
  and complexity tradeoffs for GP bandit algorithms on various hyper-parameter tuning
  tasks, suggesting the merits of managing the complexity of  GPs in bandit settings.'
