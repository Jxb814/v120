title: 'LSTM Neural Networks: Input to State Stability and Probabilistic Safety Verification'
abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural
  networks from a dynamical system perspective. The classical recursive equations
  describing the evolution of LSTM can be recast in state space form, resulting in
  a time invariant nonlinear dynamical system. In this work, a sufficient condition
  guaranteeing the Input-to-State (ISS) stability property of this system are provided.
  Then, a discussion on the verification of LSTM networks is provided; in particular,
  a dedicated approach based on the scenario algorithm is devised. The proposed method
  is eventually tested on a pH neutralization process.
