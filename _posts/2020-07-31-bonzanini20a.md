title: Learning-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control with State-Dependent Uncertainty
abstract: The increasing complexity of modern systems can introduce significant uncertainties
  to the models that describe them, which poses a great challenge to safe model-based
  control. This paper presents a learning-based stochastic model predictive control
  (LB-SMPC) strategy with chance constraints for offset-free trajectory tracking.
  The LB-SMPC strategy systematically handles plant-model mismatch between the actual
  system dynamics and a system model via a state-dependent uncertainty term that is
  intended to correct model predictions at each sampling time. A chance constraint
  handling method is presented to ensure state constraint satisfaction to a desired
  level for the case of state-dependent model uncertainty. Closed-loop simulations
  demonstrate the usefulness of LB- SMPC for predictive control of safety-critical
  systems with hard-to-model and/or time-varying dynamics.
