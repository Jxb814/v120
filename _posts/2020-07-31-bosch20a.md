title: Planning from Images with Deep Latent Gaussian Process Dynamics
abstract: Planning is a powerful approach to control problems with known environment
  dynamics. In unknown environments the agent needs to learn a model of the system
  dynamics to make planning applicable. This is particularly challenging when the
  underlying states are only indirectly observable through high-dimensional observations
  such as images. We propose to learn a deep latent Gaussian process dynamics (DLGPD)
  model that learns low-dimensional system dynamics from environment interactions
  with visual observations. The method infers latent state representations from observations
  using neural networks and models the system dynamics in the learned latent space
  with Gaussian processes. All parts of the model can be trained jointly by optimizing
  a lower bound on the likelihood of transitions in image space. We evaluate the proposed
  approach on the pendulum swing-up task while using the learned dynamics model for
  planning in latent space in order to solve the control problem. We also demonstrate
  that our method can quickly adapt a trained agent to changes in the system dynamics
  from just a few rollouts. We compare our approach to a state-of-the-art purely deep
  learning based method and demonstrate the advantages of combining Gaussian processes
  with deep learning for data efficiency and transfer learning.
