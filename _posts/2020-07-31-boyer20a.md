title: Toward fusion plasma scenario planning for NSTX-U using machine-learning-accelerated
  models
abstract: One of the most promising devices for realizing power production through
  nuclear fusion is the tokamak. To maximize performance, it is preferable that tokamak
  reactors achieve advanced operating scenarios characterized by good plasma confinement,
  improved magnetohydrodynamic stability, and a largely non-inductively driven plasma
  current. Such scenarios could enable steady-state reactor operation with high fusion
  gain â€” the ratio of produced fusion power to the external power provided through
  the plasma boundary. Precise and robust control of the evolution of the plasma boundary
  shape as well as the spatial distribution of the plasma current, density, temperature,
  and rotation will be essential to achieving and maintaining such scenarios. The
  complexity of the evolution of tokamak plasmas, arising due to nonlinearities and
  coupling between various parameters, motivates the use of model-based control algorithms
  that can account for the system dynamics. In this work, a learning-based accelerated
  model trained on data from the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade (NSTX-U)
  is employed to develop planning and control strategies for regulating the density
  and temperature profile evolution around desired trajectories. The proposed model
  combines empirical scaling laws developed across multiple devices with neural networks
  trained on empirical data from NSTX-U and a database of first-principles-based computationally
  intensive simulations. The reduced execution time of the accelerated model will
  enable practical application of optimization algorithms and reinforcement learning
  approaches for scenario planning and control development. An initial demonstration
  of applying optimization approaches to the learning-based model is presented, including
  a strategy for mitigating the effect of leaving the finite validity range of the
  accelerated model. The approach shows promise for actuator planning between experiments
  and in real-time.
