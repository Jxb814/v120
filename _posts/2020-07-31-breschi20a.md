title: Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning with data-driven reference model selection
abstract: In control applications where finding a model of the plant is the most costly
  and time consuming task, Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) represents a valid
  - purely data-driven - alternative for the design of model reference controllers.
  However, the selection of a proper reference model within a model-free setting is
  known to be a critical task, with this model typically playing the role of a hyper-parameter.
  In this work, we extend the VRFT methodology to compute both a proper reference
  model and the corresponding optimal controller parameters from data by means of
  Particle Swarm optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated
  on a benchmark simulation example.
