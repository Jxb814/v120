title: Actively Learning Gaussian Process Dynamics
abstract: Despite the availability of ever more data enabled through modern sensor
  and computer technology, it still remains an open problem to learn dynamical systems
  in a sample-efficient way.We propose active learning strategies that leverage information-theoretical
  properties arising naturally during Gaussian process regression, while respecting
  constraints on the sampling process imposed by the system dynamics. Sample points
  are selected in regions with high uncertainty, leading to exploratory behavior and
  data-efficient training of the model.All results are verified in an extensive numerical
  benchmark.
