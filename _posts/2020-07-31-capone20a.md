title: Localized active learning of Gaussian process state space models
abstract: In learning based methods for dynamical systems, exploration plays a crucial
  role, as accurate models of the dynamics need to be learned. Most of the tools developed
  so far focus on a proper exploration-exploitation trade-off to solve the given task,
  or actively strive for unknown areas of the task space. However, in the latter case,
  the exploration is performed greedily, and fails to capture the effect that learning
  in the near future will have on model uncertainty  in the distant future, effectively
  steering the system towards exploratory trajectories that yield little information.
  In this paper, we provide an information theory-based model predictive control method
  that anticipates the learning effect when exploring dynamical systems, and steers
  the system towards the most informative points. We employ a Gaussian process to
  model the system dynamics, which enables us to quantify the model uncertainty and
  estimate future information gains. We include a numerical example illustrates that
  illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
