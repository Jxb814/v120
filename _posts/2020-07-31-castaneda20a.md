title: Improving Input-Output Linearizing Controllers for Bipedal Robots via Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: The need of precise dynamics models and not being able to account for input
  constraints are two of the main drawbacks of input-output linearizing controllers.
  Model uncertainty is common in almost every robotic application, and input saturation
  is present in every real world system. In this paper, we address both challenges
  for the specific case of bipedal robots’ control by the use of reinforcement learning
  techniques. We demonstrate the performance of the designed controller for different
  uncertain scenarios on the five-link planar robot RABBIT. The advantages of the
  designed controller are highlighted and a comparison with a known effective adaptive
  controller is presented.
