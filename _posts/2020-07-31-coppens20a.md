title: Data-driven distributionally robust LQR with multiplicative noise
abstract: We present a data-driven method for solving the linear quadratic regulator
  problem for systems with multiplicative disturbances, the distribution of which
  is only known through sample estimates. We adopt a distributionally robust approach
  to cast the controller synthesis problem as semidefinite programs.  Using results
  from high dimensional statistics, the proposed methodology ensures that their solution
  provides mean-square stabilizing controllers with high probability even for low
  sample sizes.  As sample size increases the closed-loop cost approaches that of
  the optimal controller produced when the distribution is known. We demonstrate the
  practical applicability and performance of the method through a numerical experiment.
