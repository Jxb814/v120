title: Estimating Reachable Sets with Scenario  Optimization
abstract: Many practical systems are not amenable to the reachability methods that
  give guarantees of correctness, since they have dynamics that are strongly nonlinear,
  uncertain, and possibly unknown. While reachable sets for these kinds of systems
  can still be estimated in a data-driven way, data-driven methods typically do not
  guarantee the validity of their results. However, certain data-driven approaches
  may be given a probabilistic guarantee of correctness, by reframing the problem
  as a chance-constrained optimization problem that is solved with scenario optimization.
  We apply this approach to the problem of approximating a reachable set by a norm
  ball from data. The method requires only O(n^2) sample trajectories and the solution
  of a convex problem. A variant of the method restricted to axis-aligned norm balls
  requires only O(n) samples.
