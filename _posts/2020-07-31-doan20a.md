title: Finite-Time Performance of Distributed Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation
abstract: 'Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is a popular iterative method for
  finding the solution of a system of two equations. Such methods have found broad
  applications in many areas, especially in machine learning and reinforcement learning.
  In this paper, we propose a distributed variant of this method over a network of
  agents, where the agents use two graphs representing their communication at different
  speeds due to the nature of their two-time-scale updates. Our main contribution
  is to provide a finite-time analysis for the performance of the proposed method.
  In particular, we establish an upper bound for the convergence rates of the mean
  square errors at the agents to zero as a function of the step sizes and the network
  topology. We believe that the proposed method and analysis studied in this paper
  can be applicable to many other interesting applications. '
