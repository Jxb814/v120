title: 'Uncertain multi-agent MILPs: A data-driven decentralized solution with probabilistic
  feasibility guarantees'
abstract: We consider uncertain multi-agent optimization problems that are formulated
  as Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) with an almost separable structure. Specifically,
  agents have their own cost function and constraints, and need to set their local
  decision vector subject to coupling constraints due to shared resources. The problem
  is affected by uncertainty that is only known from data. A scalable decentralized
  approach to tackle the combinatorial complexity of constraint-coupled multi-agent
  MILPs has been recently introduced in the literature. However, the presence of uncertainty
  has been addressed only in a distributed convex optimization framework, i.e., without
  integer decision variables. This work fills in this gap by proposing a data-driven
  decentralized scheme to determine a solution with probabilistic feasibility guarantees
  that depend on the size of the data-set.
