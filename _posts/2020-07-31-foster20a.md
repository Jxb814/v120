title: Learning nonlinear dynamical systems from a single trajectory
abstract: 'We introduce algorithms for learning nonlinear dynamical systems of theform
  $x_{t+1}=\sigma(\Theta{}x_t)+\varepsilon_t$, where $\Theta$ is a weightmatrix, $\sigma$
  is a nonlinear monotonic link function, and$\varepsilon_t$ is a mean-zero noise
  process. When the link function is known, wegive an algorithm that recovers the
  weight matrix $\Theta$ from a single trajectorywith optimal sample complexity and
  linear running time. The algorithmsucceeds under weaker statistical assumptions
  than in previous work, and inparticular i) does not require a bound on the spectral
  norm of the weightmatrix $\Theta$ (rather, it depends on a generalization of thespectral
  radius) and ii) works when the link function is the ReLU. Our analysis has three
  keycomponents: i) We show how \emph{sequential Rademacher complexities} can beused
  to provide generalization guarantees for general dynamicalsystems, ii) we give a
  general recipe whereby global stability fornonlinear dynamical systems can be used
  to certify that the state-vector covariance is well-conditioned, and iii) using
  these tools, we extend well-known algorithms for efficiently learning generalized
  linear models to the dependent setting.'
