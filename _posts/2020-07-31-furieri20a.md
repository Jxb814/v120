title: Learning the Globally Optimal Distributed LQ Regulator
abstract: 'We study model-free learning methods for the output-feedback Linear Quadratic
  (LQ) control problem in finite-horizon subject to subspace constraints on the control
  policy. Subspace constraints naturally arise in the field of distributed control
  and present a significant challenge in the sense that standard model-based optimization
  and learning leads to intractable numerical programs in general.  Building upon
  recent results in zeroth-order optimization, we establish model-free sample-complexity
  bounds for the class of distributed LQ problems where a local gradient dominance
  constant exists on any sublevel set of the cost function. We prove that a fundamental
  class of distributed control problems - commonly referred to as Quadratically Invariant
  (QI) problems - as well as others possess this property. To the best of our knowledge,
  our result is the first sample-complexity bound guarantee on learning globally optimal
  distributed output-feedback control policies. '
