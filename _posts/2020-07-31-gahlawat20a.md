title: 'L1-GP: L1 Adaptive Control with Bayesian Learning'
abstract: We present L1-GP, an architecture based on L1 adaptive control and Gaussian
  Process Regression (GPR) for safe simultaneous control and learning. On one hand,
  the L1 adaptive control provides stability and transient performance guarantees,
  which allows for GPR to efficiently and safely learn the uncertain dynamics. On
  the other hand, the learned dynamics can be conveniently incorporated into the L1
  control architecture without sacrificing robustness and tracking performance. Subsequently,
  the learned dynamics can lead to less conservative designs for performance/robustness
  tradeoff. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture via numerical
  simulations.
