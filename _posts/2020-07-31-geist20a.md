title: Learning Constrained Dynamics  with Gauss’ Principle adhering Gaussian Processes
abstract: 'The identification of the constrained dynamics of mechanical systems is
  often challenging. Learning methods promise to ease an analytical analysis, but
  require considerable amounts of data for training. We propose to combine insights
  from analytical mechanics with Gaussian process regression to improve the model’s
  data efficiency and constraint integrity. The result is a Gaussian process model
  that incorporates a priori constraint knowledge such that its predictions adhere
  Gauss’ principle of least constraint. In return, predictions of the system’s acceleration
  naturally respect potentially non-ideal (non-)holonomic equality constraints. As
  corollary results, our model enables to infer the acceleration of the unconstrained
  system from data of the constrained system and enables knowledge transfer between
  differing constraint configurations. '
