title: A Finite-Sample Deviation Bound for Stable Autoregressive Processes
abstract: 'In this paper, we study non-asymptotic deviation bounds of the least squares
  estimator in Gaussian AR($n$) processes. By relying on martingale concentration
  inequalities and a tail-bound for $\chi^2$ distributed variables, we provide a concentration
  bound for the sample covariance matrix of the process output. With this, we present
  a problem-dependent finite-time bound on the deviation probability of any fixed
  linear combination of the estimated parameters of the AR$(n)$ process. We discuss
  extensions and limitations of our approach. '
