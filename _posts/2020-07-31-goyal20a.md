title: 'NeuralExplorer: State Space Exploration of Closed Loop Control Systems Using
  Neural Networks'
abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for performing state space exploration
  of closed loop control systems. For closed loop control systems, we introduce the
  notion of inverse sensitivity function and present a mechanism for approximating
  inverse sensitivity by a neural network. This neural network can be used for generating
  trajectories that reach a destination (or a neighborhood around it). We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to standard nonlinear dynamical
  systems, nonlinear hybrid systems, and also neural network based feedback control
  systems.
