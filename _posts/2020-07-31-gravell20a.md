title: Robust Learning-Based Control via Bootstrapped Multiplicative Noise
abstract: 'Despite decades of research and recent progress in adaptive control and
  reinforcement learning, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding in designing
  controllers that provide robustness to inherent non-asymptotic uncertainties arising
  from models estimated with finite, noisy data. We propose a robust adaptive control
  algorithm that explicitly incorporates such non-asymptotic uncertainties into the
  control design. The algorithm has three components: (1) a least-squares nominal
  model estimator; (2) a bootstrap resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic
  variance of the nominal model estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control
  design method using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with multiplicative
  noise. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification
  and robust control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations,
  so that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns with
  the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against. We show through
  numerical experiments that the proposed robust adaptive controller can significantly
  outperform the certainty equivalent controller on both expected regret and measures
  of regret risk.'
