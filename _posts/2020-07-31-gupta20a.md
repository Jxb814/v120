title: Structured Mechanical Models for Robot Learning and Control
abstract: Model-based methods are the dominant paradigm for controlling robotic systems,
  though their efficacy depends heavily on the accuracy of the model used. Deep neural
  networks have been used to learn models of robot dynamics from data, but they suffer
  from data-inefficiency and the difficulty to incorporate prior knowledge. We introduce
  Structured Mechanical Models, a flexible model class for mechanical systems that
  are data-efficient, easily amenable to prior knowledge, and easily usable with model-based
  control techniques. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the benefits of using
  Structured Mechanical Models in lieu of black-box neural networks when modeling
  robot dynamics. We demonstrate that they generalize better from limited data and
  yield more reliable model-based controllers on a variety of simulated robotic domains.
