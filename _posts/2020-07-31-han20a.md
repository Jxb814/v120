title: Localized Learning of Robust Controllers for Networked Systems with Dynamic
  Topology
abstract: Our previous work proposed an approach to localized adaptive and robust
  control over a large-scale network of systems subject to a single topological modification.
  In this paper, we develop this approach into an iterative scheme to handle multiple
  topological modifications over time, which switch between configurations in a finite-state
  Markov chain. Each system in the network uses its local information to robustly
  control its own state while also learning the current state of the network topology
  (i.e. which state of the Markov chain it is currently in). Additionally, each system
  maintains an estimate of certain parameters for the overall network, for instance,
  the transition probabilities of the Markov chain, and each system uses standard
  average consensus methods to update its estimate. We simulate a simple centered
  hexagon network with 7 systems and 4 different topological states, and show that
  each system in the network manages to stabilize under a control law that uses only
  local information, and adapts to the current topology within a reasonable amount
  of time after a switch is made.
