title: On Simulation and Trajectory Prediction with Gaussian Process Dynamics
abstract: Established techniques for simulation and prediction with Gaussian process
  (GP) dynamics implicitly make use of an independence assumption on successive function
  evaluations of the dynamics model. This can result in significant error and underestimation
  of the prediction uncertainty, potentially leading to failures in safety-critical
  applications. This paper proposes methods that explicitly take the correlation of
  successive function evaluations into account. We first describe two sampling-based
  techniques; one approach provides samples of the true trajectory distribution, suitable
  for ‘ground truth’ simulations, while the other draws function samples from basis
  function approximations of the GP. Second, we present a linearization-based technique
  that directly provides approximations of the trajectory distribution, taking correlations
  explicitly into account. We demonstrate the procedures in simple numerical examples,
  contrasting the results with established methods.
