title: 'NeurOpt: Neural network based optimization for building energy management
  and climate control'
abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) can provide significant energy cost savings
  in building operations in the form of energy-efficient control with better occupant
  comfort, lower peak demand charges, and risk-free participation in demand response.
  However, the engineering effort required to obtain physics-based models of buildings
  for MPC is considered to be the biggest bottleneck in making MPC scalable to real
  buildings. In this paper, we propose a data-driven control algorithm based on neural
  networks to reduce this cost of model identification. Our approach does not require
  building domain expertise or retrofitting of the existing heating and cooling systems.
  We validate our learning and control algorithms on a two-story building with 10
  independently controlled zones, located in Italy. We learn dynamical models of energy
  consumption and zone temperatures with high accuracy and demonstrate energy savings
  and better occupant comfort compared to the default system controller.
