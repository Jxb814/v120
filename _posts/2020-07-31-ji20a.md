title: Feed-forward Neural Network with Trainable Delay and Application to Car-following
abstract: In this paper we build a bridge between feed-forward neural networks and
  delayed dynamical systems. As an initial demonstration, we capture the car-following
  behavior of a connected automated vehicle including time delay using both simulation
  data and experimental data. We construct a delayed feed-forward neural network (DFNN)
  and introduce a training algorithm in order to learn the delay. We demonstrate that
  this algorithm works well on the proposed structures and can be extended to capture
  the behavior of other dynamical systems with delay.
