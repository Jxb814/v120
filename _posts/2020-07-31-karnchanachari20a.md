title: 'Practical Reinforcement Learning For MPC: Learning from sparse objectives
  in under an hour on a real robot'
abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control technique that handles
  constraints, takes the systemâ€™s dynamics into account, and is optimal with respect
  to a given cost function. In practice, however, it often requires an expert to craft
  and tune this cost function and find trade-offs between different state penalties
  to satisfy simple high level objectives. In this paper, we use Reinforcement Learning
  and in particular value learning to approximate the value function given only high
  level objectives, which can be sparse and binary. Building upon previous works,
  we present improvements that allowed us to successfully deploy the method on a real
  world unmanned ground vehicle. Our experiments show that our method can learn the
  cost function from scratch and without human intervention, while reaching a performance
  level similar to that of an expert-tuned MPC. We perform a quantitative comparison
  of these methods with standard MPC approaches both in simulation and on the real
  robot.
