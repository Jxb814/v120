title: 'VarNet: Variational Neural Networks for the Solution of Partial Differential
  Equations'
abstract: We propose a new model-based unsupervised learning method, called VarNet,
  for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep neural networks.
  Particularly, we propose a novel loss function that relies on the variational (integral)
  form of PDEs as apposed to their differential form which is commonly used in the
  literature. Our loss function is discretization-free, highly parallelizable, and
  more effective in capturing the solution of PDEs since it employs lower-order derivatives
  and trains over measure non-zero regions of space-time. The models obtained using
  VarNet are smooth and do not require interpolation. They are also easily differentiable
  and can directly be used for control and optimization of PDEs. Finally, VarNet can
  straight-forwardly incorporate parametric PDE models making it a natural tool for
  model order reduction of PDEs.
