title: Probabilistic Safety Constraints for Learned High Relative Degree System Dynamics
abstract: This paper focuses on learning a model of system dynamics online while satisfying
  safety constraints. Our motivation is to avoid offline system identification or
  hand-specified dynamics models and allow a system to safely and autonomously estimate
  and adapt its own model during online operation. Given streaming observations of
  the system state, we use Bayesian learning to obtain a distribution over the system
  dynamics. In turn, the distribution is used to optimize the system behavior and
  ensure safety with high probability, by specifying a chance constraint over a control
  barrier function.
