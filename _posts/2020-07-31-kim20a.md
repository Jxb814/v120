title: Learning to Correspond Dynamical Systems
abstract: Many dynamical systems exhibit similar structure, as often captured by hand-designed
  simplified models that can be used for analysis and control. We develop a method
  for learning to correspond pairs of dynamical systems via a learned latent dynamical
  system. Given trajectory data from two dynamical systems, we learn a shared latent
  state space and a shared latent dynamics model, along with an encoder-decoder pair
  for each of the original systems. With the learned correspondences in place, we
  can use a simulation of one system to produce an imagined motion of its counterpart.
  We can also simulate in the learned latent dynamics and synthesize the motions of
  both corresponding systems, as a form of bisimulation. We demonstrate the approach
  using pairs of controlled bipedal walkers, as well as by pairing a walker with a
  controlled pendulum.
