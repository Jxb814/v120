title: Objective Mismatch in Model-based Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful
  framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work
  in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning
  schemes, with little development of the general framework.In this paper, we identify
  a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework â€“ what we call the objective
  mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the
  hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context
  of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics
  model w.r.t. the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal
  of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can
  emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do
  not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models
  might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on
  a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and
  demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated
  with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the
  MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed.
  We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics
  model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential
  directions of research for addressing this issue.
