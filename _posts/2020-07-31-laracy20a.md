title: Constraint Management for Batch Processes Using Iterative Learning Control
  and Reference Governors
abstract: " This paper provides a novel combination of Reference Governors (RG) and
  Iterative Learning Control (ILC) to address the issue of simultaneous learning and
  constraint management in systems that perform a task repeatedly. The proposed control
  strategy leverages the measured output from the previous iterations to improve tracking,
  while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during the learning process. To achieve
  this, the system is modeled by a linear system with polytopic uncertainties. An
  RG solution based on a robust Maximal Admissable Set (MAS) is proposed that endows
  the ILC algorithm with constraint management capabilities. An update law on the
  MAS is proposed to further improve performance."
