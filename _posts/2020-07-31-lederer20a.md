title: Parameter Optimization for Learning-based Control of Control-Affine Systems
abstract: Supervised machine learning is often applied to identify system dynamics
  where first principle methods fail. When combining learning with control methods,
  probabilistic regression is typically applied to increase robustness against learning
  errors and analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. Although this approach
  allows to formulate performance guarantees for many control techniques, the obtained
  bounds are usually conservative, and cannot be employed for efficient control parameter
  tuning. Therefore, we reformulate the parameter tuning problem using robust optimization
  with performance constraints based on Lyapunov theory. By relaxing the problem through
  scenario optimization we derive a provably optimal method for control parameter
  tuning. We demonstrate its flexibility and efficiency on parameter tuning problems
  for a feedback linearizing and a computed torque controller.
