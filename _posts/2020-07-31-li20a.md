title: Generating Robust Supervision for Learning-Based Visual Navigation Using Hamilton-Jacobi
  Reachability
abstract: In Bansal et al. (2019), a novel visual navigation framework that combines
  learning-based and model-based approaches has been proposed. Specifically, a Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN) predicts a waypoint that is used by the dynamics model for
  planning and tracking a trajectory to the waypoint. However, the CNN inevitably
  makes prediction errors, ultimately leading to collisions, especially when the robot
  is navigating through cluttered and tight spaces. In this paper, we present a novel
  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based method to generate supervision for the CNN
  for waypoint prediction. By modeling the prediction error of the CNN as disturbances
  in dynamics, the proposed method generates waypoints that are robust to these disturbances,
  and consequently to the prediction errors. Moreover, using globally optimal HJ reachability
  analysis leads to predicting waypoints that are time-efficient and do not exhibit
  greedy behavior. Through simulations and experiments on a hardware testbed, we demonstrate
  the advantages of the proposed approach for navigation tasks where the robot needs
  to navigate through cluttered, narrow indoor environments.
