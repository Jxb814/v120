title: 'Lambda-Policy Iteration with Randomization for Contractive Models with Infinite
  Policies: Well-Posedness and Convergence'
abstract: 'Abstract dynamic programming models are used to analyze $\lambda$-policy
  iteration with randomization algorithms. Particularly, contractive models with infinite
  policies are considered and it is shown that well-posedness of the $\lambda$-operator
  plays a central role in the algorithm. The operator is known to be well-posed for
  problems with finite states, but our analysis shows that it is also well-defined
  for the contractive models with infinite states studied. Similarly, the algorithm
  we analyze is known to converge for problems with finite policies, but we identify
  the conditions required to guarantee convergence with probability one when the policy
  space is infinite regardless of the number of states. Guided by the analysis, we
  exemplify a data-driven approximated implementation of the algorithm for estimation
  of optimal costs of constrained linear and nonlinear control problems. Numerical
  results indicate potentials of this method in practice. '
