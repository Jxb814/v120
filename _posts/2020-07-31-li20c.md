title: 'Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Linear Quadratic Control:
  A Derivative-Free Policy Optimization Approach'
abstract: 'This paper considers a distributed reinforcement learning problem for decentralized
  linear quadratic control with partial state observations and local costs. We propose
  a Zero-Order Distributed Policy Optimization algorithm (ZODPO) that learns linear
  local controllers in a distributed fashion, leveraging the ideas of policy gradient,
  zero-order optimization and consensus algorithms. In ZODPO, each agent estimates
  the global cost by consensus, and then conducts local policy gradient in parallel
  based on zero-order gradient estimation. ZODPO only requires limited communication
  and storage even in large-scale systems. Further, we investigate the nonasymptotic
  performance of ZODPO and show that the sample complexity to approach a stationary
  point is polynomial with the error toleranceâ€™s inverse and the problem dimensions,
  demonstrating the scalability of ZODPO. We also show that the controllers generated
  throughout ZODPO are stabilizing controllers with high probability. Lastly, we numerically
  test ZODPO on a multi-zone HVAC system. '
