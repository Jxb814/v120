title: Learning supported Model Predictive Control for Tracking of Periodic References
abstract: Increased autonomy of controllers in tasks with uncertainties stemming from
  the interaction with the environment can be achieved by incorporation of learning.
  Examples are control tasks where the system should follow a reference which depends
  on measurement data from surrounding systems as e.g. humans or other control systems.
  We propose a learning strategy for Gaussian processes to model, filter and predict
  references for control systems under model predictive control. Hereby constraints
  in the learning are included to achieve safety guarantees as trackability and recursive
  feasibility. An illustrative simulation example for motion compensation is given
  which shows performance improvements of combined constrained learning and predictive
  control besides the provided guarantees.
