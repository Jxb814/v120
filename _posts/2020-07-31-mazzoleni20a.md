title: 'Black-box continuous-time transfer function estimation with stability guarantees:
  a kernel-based approach'
abstract: Continuous-time parametric models of dynamical systems are usually preferred
  given their physical interpretation. When there is a lack of prior physical knowledge,
  the user is faced with the model selection issue. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric
  approach to estimate a continuous-time stable linear model from data, while automatically
  selecting a proper structure of the transfer function and guaranteeing to preserve
  the system stability properties. Results show how the proposed approach outperforms
  the state of the art.
