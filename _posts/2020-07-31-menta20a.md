title: Learning solutions to hybrid control problems using Benders cuts
abstract: Hybrid control problems are complicated by the need to make a suitable sequence
  of discrete decisions related to future modes of operation of the system. Model
  predictive control (MPC) encodes a finite-horizon truncation of such problems as
  a mixed-integer program, and then imposes a cost and/or constraints on the terminal
  state intended to reflect all post-horizon behaviour. However, these are often ad
  hoc choices tuned by hand after empirically observing performance. We present a
  learning method that sidesteps this problem, in which the so-called N-step Q-function
  of the problem is approximated from below, using Bendersâ€™ decomposition. The function
  takes a state and a sequence of N control decisions as arguments, and therefore
  extends the traditional notion of a Q-function from reinforcement learning. After
  learning it from a training process exploring the state-input space, we use it in
  place of the usual MPC objective. We take an example hybrid control task and show
  that it can be completed successfully with a shorter planning horizon than conventional
  hybrid MPC thanks to our proposed method. Furthermore, we report that Q-functions
  trained with long horizons can be truncated to a shorter horizon for online use,
  yielding simpler control laws with apparently little loss of performance.
