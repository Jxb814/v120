title: Learning the model-free linear quadratic regulator via random search
abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning attempts to find an optimal control action
  for an unknown dynamical system by directly searching over the parameter space of
  controllers. The convergence behavior and statistical properties of these approaches
  are often poorly understood because of the nonconvex nature of the underlying optimization
  problems as well as the lack of exact gradient computation. In this paper, we examine
  the standard infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator problem for continuous-time
  systems with unknown state-space parameters. We provide theoretical bounds on the
  convergence rate and sample complexity of a random search method. Our results demonstrate
  that the required simulation time for achieving $\epsilon$-accuracy in a model-free
  setup and the total number of function evaluations are both of $O (\log \, (1/\epsilon)
  )$.
