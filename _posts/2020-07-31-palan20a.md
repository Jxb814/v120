title: Fitting a Linear Control Policy to Demonstrations with a Kalman Constraint
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a linear control policy for a linear
  dynamical system, from demonstrations of an expert regulating the system. The standard
  approach to this problem is (linear) policy fitting, which fits a linear policy
  by minimizing a loss function between the demonstrations and the policyâ€™s outputs
  plus a regularization function that encodes prior knowledge. Despite its simplicity,
  this method fails to learn policies with low or even finite cost when there are
  few demonstrations. We propose to add an additional constraint to the regularization
  function in policy fitting, that the policy is the solution to some LQR problem,
  i.e., optimal in the stochastic control sense for some choice of quadratic cost.
  We refer to this constraint as a Kalman constraint. Policy fitting with a Kalman
  constraint requires solving an optimization problem with convex cost and bilinear
  constraints. We propose a heuristic method, based on the alternating direction method
  of multipliers (ADMM), to approximately solve this problem. An illustrative numerical
  experiment demonstrates that adding the Kalman constraint allows us to learn good,
  i.e., low cost, policies even when very few data are available.
