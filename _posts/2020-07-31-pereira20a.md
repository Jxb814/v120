title: Feynman-Kac Neural Network Architectures for Stochastic Control Using Second-Order
  FBSDE Theory
abstract: We present a deep recurrent neural network architecture to solve a class
  of stochastic optimal control problems described by fully nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi
  Bellman partial differential equations. Such PDEs arise when considering stochastic
  dynamics characterized by uncertainties that are additive, state dependent, and
  control multiplicative. Stochastic models with these characteristics are important
  in computational neuroscience, biology, finance, and aerospace systems and provide
  a more accurate representation of actuation than models with only additive uncertainty.
  Previous literature has established the inadequacy of the linear HJB theory for
  such problems, so instead, methods relying on the generalized version of the Feynman-Kac
  lemma have been proposed resulting in a system of second-order Forward-Backward
  SDEs. However, so far, these methods suffer from compounding errors resulting in
  lack of scalability. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based algorithm that
  leverages the second-order FBSDE representation and LSTM-based recurrent neural
  networks to not only solve such stochastic optimal control problems but also overcome
  the problems faced by traditional approaches, including scalability. The resulting
  control algorithm is tested on a high-dimensional linear system and three nonlinear
  systems from robotics and biomechanics in simulation to demonstrate feasibility
  and out-performance against previous methods.
