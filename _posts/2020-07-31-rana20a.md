title: 'Euclideanizing Flows: Diffeomorphic Reduction for Learning Stable Dynamical
  Systems'
abstract: Execution of complex tasks in robotics requires motions that have complex
  geometric structure. We present an approach which allows robots to learn such motions
  from a few human demonstrations. The motions are encoded as rollouts of a dynamical
  system on a Riemannian manifold. Additional structure is imposed which guarantees
  smooth convergent motions to a goal location. The aforementioned structure involves
  viewing motions on an observed Riemannian manifold as deformations of straight lines
  on a latent Euclidean space. The observed and latent spaces are related through
  a diffeomorphism. Thus, this paper presents an approach for learning flexible diffeomorphisms,
  resulting in a stable dynamical system.  The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated
  through validation on an established benchmark as well demonstrations collected
  on a real-world robotic system.
