title: Sparse and Low-bias Estimation of High Dimensional Vector Autoregressive Models
abstract: Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used for causal discovery
  and forecasting in multivariate time series analysis. In the high-dimensional setting,
  which is increasingly common in fields such as neuroscience and econometrics, model
  parameters are inferred by $L_1$-regularized maximum likelihood (RML). A well-known
  feature of RML inference is that in general the technique produces a trade-off between
  sparsity and bias that depends on the choice of the regularization hyperparameter.
  In the context of multivariate time series analysis, sparse estimates are favorable
  for causal discovery and low-bias estimates are favorable for forecasting. However,
  owing to a paucity of research on hyperparameter selection methods, practitioners
  must rely on <em>ad-hoc</em> methods such as cross-validation (or manual tuning).
  The particular balance that such approaches achieve between the two goals — causal
  discovery and forecasting — is poorly understood. Our paper investigates this behavior
  and proposes a method (UoI-VAR) that achieves a better balance between sparsity
  and bias when the underlying causal influences are in fact sparse. We demonstrate
  through simulation that RML with a hyperparameter selected by cross-validation tends
  to overfit, producing relatively dense estimates. We further demonstrate that UoI-VAR
  much more effectively approximates the correct sparsity pattern with only a minor
  compromise in model fit, particularly so for larger data dimensions, and that the
  estimates produced by UoI-VAR exhibit less bias. We conclude that our method
  achieves improved performance especially well-suited to applications involving simultaneous
  causal discovery and forecasting in high-dimensional settings.
