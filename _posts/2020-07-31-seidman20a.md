title: 'Robust Deep Learning as Optimal Control: Insights and Convergence Guarantees'
abstract: The fragility of deep neural networks to adversarially-chosen inputs has
  motivated the need to revisit deep learning algorithms. Including adversarial examples
  during training is a popular defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. This
  mechanism can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the adversary
  seeks to maximize the loss function using an iterative first-order algorithm while
  the learner attempts to minimize it. However, finding adversarial examples in this
  way causes excessive computational overhead during training. By interpreting the
  min-max problem as an optimal control problem, it has recently been shown that one
  can exploit the compositional structure of neural networks in the optimization problem
  to  improve the training time significantly. In this paper, we provide the first
  convergence analysis of this adversarial training algorithm by combining techniques
  from robust optimal control and inexact oracle methods in optimization. Our analysis
  sheds light on how the hyperparameters of the algorithm affect the its stability
  and convergence. We support our insights with experiments on a robust classification
  problem.
