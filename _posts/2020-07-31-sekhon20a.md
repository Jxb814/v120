title: A Spatially and Temporally Attentive Joint Trajectory Prediction Framework
  for Modeling Vessel Intent
abstract: Ships, or vessels, often sail in and out of cluttered environments over
  the course of their trajectories. Safe navigation in such cluttered scenarios requires
  an accurate estimation of the intent of neighboring vessels and their effect on
  the self and vice-versa well into the future. In manned vessels, this is achieved
  by constant communication between people on board, nautical experience, and audio
  and visual signals. In this paper we propose a deep neural network based architecture
  to predict intent of neighboring vessels into the future for an unmanned vessel
  solely based on positional data.
