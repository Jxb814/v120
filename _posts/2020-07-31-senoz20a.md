title: Bayesian joint state and parameter tracking in autoregressive models
abstract: We address the problem of online Bayesian state and parameter tracking in
  autoregressive (AR) models with time-varying process noise variance. The involved
  marginalization and expectation integrals cannot be analytically solved. Moreover,
  the online tracking constraint makes sampling and batch learning methods unsuitable
  for this problem. We propose a hybrid variational message passing algorithm that
  robustly tracks the time-varying dynamics of the latent states, AR coefficients
  and process noise variance. Since message passing in a factor graph is a highly
  modular inference approach, the proposed methods easily extend to other non-stationary
  dynamic modeling problems.
