title: Faster saddle-point  optimization for solving large-scale Markov decision processes
abstract: We consider the problem of computing optimal policies in average-reward
  Markov decision processes. This classical problem can be formulated as a linear
  program directly amenable to saddle-point optimization methods, albeit with a number
  of variables that is linear in the number of states. To address this issue, recent
  work has considered a linearly relaxed version of the resulting saddle-point problem.
  Our work aims at achieving a better understanding of this relaxed optimization problem
  by characterizing the conditions necessary for convergence to the optimal policy,
  and designing an optimization algorithm enjoying fast convergence rates that are
  independent of the size of the state space. Notably, our characterization points
  out some potential issues with previous work.
