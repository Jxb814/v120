title: Tools for Data-driven Modeling of Within-Hand Manipulation with Underactuated
  Adaptive Hands
abstract: 'Precise in-hand manipulation is an important skill for a robot to perform
  tasks in human environments. Practical robotic hands must be low-cost, easy to control
  and capable. 3D-printed underactuated adaptive hands provide such properties as
  they are cheap to fabricate and adapt to objects of uncertain geometry with stable
  grasps. Challenges still remain, however, before such hands can attain human-like
  performance due to complex dynamics and contacts. In particular, useful models for
  planning, control or model-based reinforcement learning are still lacking. Recently,
  data-driven approaches for such models have shown promise. This work provides the
  first large public dataset of real within-hand manipulation that facilitates building
  such models, along with baseline data-driven modeling results. Furthermore, it contributes
  ROS-based physics-engine model of such hands for independent data collection, experimentation
  and sim-to-reality transfer work. '
