title: Data-driven Identification of Approximate Passive Linear Models for Nonlinear
  Systems
abstract: 'In model-based approaches to learning for controller design, it is important
  to first identify a system model from input-output data. Assume that we have access
  to some information about the true system satisfying a structural property that
  makes it easy to design a controller and obtain a desired performance or stability
  guarantee on the closed loop system. Can we identify a system model that satisfies
  this property? In this paper, we consider the property to be that of passivity,
  that can be used to ensure stability with a learned controller. We present an algorithm
  to learn a passive linear model of a unknown passive nonlinear system from time
  domain input-output data. We first learn an approximate linear model of the nonlinear
  system using standard regression techniques. We then perturb the system matrices
  of the linear model to enforce passivity. We show that the perturbation can be chosen
  to ensure that the linear model closely approximates the dynamical behavior of the
  nonlinear system. Further, we provide an analytical relationship between the size
  of the perturbation and the radius in which the passivity of the linear model guarantees
  local passivity of the unknown nonlinear system. '
