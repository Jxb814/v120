title: Identifying Mechanical Models of Unknown Objects with Differentiable Physics
  Simulations
abstract: This paper proposes a new method for manipulating unknown objects through
  a sequence of non-prehensile actions that displace an object from its initial configuration
  to a given goal configuration on a flat surface. The proposed method leverages recent
  progress in differentiable physics models to identify unknown mechanical properties
  of manipulated objects, such as inertia matrix, friction coefficients and external
  forces acting on the object. To this end, a recently proposed differentiable physics
  engine for two-dimensional objects is adopted in this work and extended to deal
  forces in the three-dimensional space. The proposed model identification technique
  analytically computes the gradient of the distance between forecasted poses of objects
  and their actual observed poses, and utilizes that gradient to search for values
  of the mechanical properties that reduce the reality gap.
