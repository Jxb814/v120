title: 'Lyceum: An efficient and scalable ecosystem for robot learning'
abstract: 'We introduce Lyceum, a high-performance computational ecosystem for robot
  learning. Lyceum is built on top of the Julia programming language and the MuJoCo
  physics simulator, combining the ease-of-use of a high-level programming language
  with the performance of native C. In addition,Lyceum has a straightforward API to
  support parallel computation across multiple cores and machines.  Overall, depending
  on the complexity of the environment,Lyceum is 5-30X faster compared to other popular
  abstractions like OpenAI’s Gym and DeepMind’s dm-control. This substantially reduces
  training time for various reinforcement learning algorithms; and is also fast enough
  to support real-time model predictive control through MuJoCo.  The code, tutorials,
  and demonstration videos can be found at: www.lyceum.ml.'
