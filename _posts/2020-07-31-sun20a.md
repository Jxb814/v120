title: 'Finite Sample System Identification: Optimal Rates and the Role of Regularization'
abstract: 'This paper studies the optimality of regularized regression for low order
  linear system identification. The nuclear norm of the systemâ€™s Hankel matrix is
  added as a regularizer to the least squares cost function due to the following advantages:
  (1) its easy to tune regularzation weight, (2) lower sample complexity, (3) returning
  a Hankel matrix with a clear singular value gap, which robustly recovers a low-order
  linear system from noisy output observations. Recently, the performance of unregularized
  least squares formulations have been studied statistically in terms of finite sample
  complexity and recovery error; however, no results are known for the regularized
  approach. In this work, we show that with the advantage of sample complexity kept,
  the regularized algorithm beats unregularized least squares in Hankel spectral norm
  bound.'
