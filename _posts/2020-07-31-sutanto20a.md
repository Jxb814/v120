title: Encoding Physical Constraints in Differentiable Newton-Euler Algorithm
abstract: The recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA) is a popular technique in robotics
  for computing the dynamics of robots. The computed dynamics can then be used for
  torque control with inverse dynamics, or for forward dynamics computations. RNEA
  can be framed as a differentiable computational graph, enabling the dynamics parameters
  of the robot to be learned from data. However, the dynamics parameters learned in
  this manner can be physically implausible. In this work, we incorporate physical
  constraints in the learning by adding structure to the learned parameters. This
  results in a framework that can learn physically plausible dynamics, improving the
  training speed as well as generalization of the learned dynamics models. We evaluate
  our method on real-time inverse dynamics predictions of a 7 degree of freedom robot
  arm, both in simulation and on the real robot. Our experiments study a spectrum
  of structure added to learned dynamics, and compare their performance and generalization.
