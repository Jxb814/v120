title: Learning for Safety-Critical Control with Control Barrier Functions
abstract: Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to endow systems with properties of
  stability and safety, and have been deployed successfully in multiple domains. Despite
  this success, model uncertainty remains a significant challenge in synthesizing
  safe controllers, leading to degradation in the properties provided by the controllers.
  This paper develops a machine learning framework utilizing Control Barrier Functions
  (CBFs) to reduce model uncertainty as it impact the safe behavior of a system. This
  approach iteratively collects data and updates a controller, ultimately achieving
  safe behavior. We validate this method in simulation and experimentally on a Segway
  platform.
