title: Sample Complexity of Kalman Filtering for Unknown Systems
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider the task of designing a Kalman Filter (KF) for
  an unknown and partially observed autonomous linear time invariant system driven
  by process and sensor noise.  To do so, we propose studying the following two step
  process: first, using system identification tools rooted in subspace methods, we
  obtain coarse finite-data estimates of the state-space parameters, and Kalman gain
  describing the autonomous system; and second, we use these approximate parameters
  to design a filter which produces estimates of the system state.  We show that when
  the system identification step produces sufficiently accurate estimates, or when
  the underlying true KF is sufficiently robust, that a Certainty Equivalent (CE)
  KF, i.e., one designed using the estimated parameters directly, enjoys provable
  sub-optimality guarantees.  We further show that when these conditions fail, and
  in particular, when the CE KF is marginally stable (i.e., has eigenvalues very close
  to the unit circle), that imposing additional robustness constraints on the filter
  leads to similar sub-optimality guarantees.  We further show that with high probability,
  both the CE and robust filters have mean prediction error bounded by the order of
  inverse square root of N, where N is the number of data points collected in the
  system identification step.  To the best of our knowledge, these are the first end-to-end
  sample complexity bounds for the Kalman Filtering of an unknown system.  '
