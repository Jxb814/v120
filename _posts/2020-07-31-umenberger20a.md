title: Optimistic robust linear quadratic dual control
abstract: Recent work by Mania et al. has proved that certainty equivalent control
  achieves optimal regret for linear systems and quadratic costs. However, when parameter
  uncertainty is large, certainty equivalence cannot be relied upon to stabilize the
  true, unknown system. In this paper, we present a dual control strategy that attempts
  to combine the performance of certainty equivalence, with the practical utility
  of robustness. The formulation preserves structure in the representation of parametric
  uncertainty, which allows the controller to target reduction of uncertainty in the
  parameters that ‘matter most’ for the control task, while robustly stabilizing the
  uncertain system. Control synthesis proceeds via convex optimization, and the method
  is illustrated on a numerical example.
