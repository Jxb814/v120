title: Smart Forgetting for Safe  Online Learning with Gaussian Processes
abstract: The identification of unknown dynamical systems using supervised learning
  enables model-based control of systems that cannot be modeled based on first principles.
  While most control literature focuses on the analysis of a static dataset, online
  learning control, where data points are added while the controller is running, has
  rarely been studied in depth. In this paper, we present a novel approach for online
  learning control based on Gaussian process models. To avoid computational difficulties
  with growing datasets, we propose a safe forgetting mechanism. Using an entropy
  criterion, data points are evaluated with respect to the future trajectory of the
  closed loop system and are “forgotten” if the stability of the system can further
  be guaranteed. The approach is evaluated in a simulation and in a robotic experiment
  to show its real-time capability.
