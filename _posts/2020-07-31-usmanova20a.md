title: Safe non-smooth black-box optimization with application to policy search
abstract: For safety-critical black-box optimization tasks, observations of the constraints
  and the objective are often noisy and available only for the feasible points. We
  propose an approach based on log barriers to find a local solution of a non-convex
  non-smooth black-box optimization problem $\min f^0(x)$ subject to  $f^i(x)\leq
  0, i = 1,\ldots, m$, at the same time, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction while
  learning with high probability. Our proposed algorithm exploits noisy observations
  to iteratively improve on an initial safe point until convergence.  We derive the
  convergence rate and prove safety of our algorithm. We demonstrate its performance
  in an application to an iterative control design problem.
