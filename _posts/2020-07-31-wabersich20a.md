title: 'Bayesian model predictive control: Efficient model exploration and regret
  bounds using posterior sampling'
abstract: Tight performance specifications in combination with operational constraints
  make model predictive control (MPC) the method of choice in various industries.
  As the performance of an MPC controller depends on a sufficiently accurate objective
  and prediction model of the process, a significant effort in the MPC design procedure
  is dedicated to modeling and identification. Driven by the increasing amount of
  available system data and advances in the field of machine learning, data-driven
  MPC techniques have been developed to facilitate the MPC controller design. While
  these methods are able to leverage available data, they typically do not provide
  principled mechanisms to automatically trade off exploitation of available data
  and exploration to improve and update the objective and prediction model. To this
  end, we present a learning-based MPC formulation using posterior sampling techniques,
  which provides finite-time regret bounds on the learning performance while being
  simple to implement using off-the-shelf MPC software and algorithms. The performance
  analysis of the method is based on posterior sampling theory and its practical efficiency
  is illustrated using a numerical example of a highly nonlinear dynamical car-trailer
  system.
