title: Learning Navigation Costs from Demonstrations with Semantic Observations
abstract: This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for autonomous
  robot navigation using semantic observations. The objective is to infer a cost function
  that explains demonstrated behavior while relying only on the expertâ€™s observations
  and state-control trajectory. We develop a map encoder, which infers semantic class
  probabilities from the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined as deep
  neural network over the semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly
  ob-servable, the representation parameters can only be optimized by differentiating
  the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost
  estimate. The error is optimized using a closed-form subgradient computed only over
  a subset of promising states via a motion planning algorithm. We show that our approach
  learns to follow traffic rules in the autonomous driving CARLA simulator by relying
  on semantic observations of cars, sidewalks and road lanes.
