title: A First Principles Approach for Data-Efficient System Identification of Spring-Rod
  Systems via Differentiable Physics Engines
abstract: We propose a novel differentiable physics engine for system identification
  of complex spring-rod assemblies. Unlike black-box  data-driven methods for learning
  the evolution of a dynamical system and its parameters, we modularize the design
  of our engine using a discrete form of the governing equations of motion, similar
  to a traditional physics engine. We further reduce the dimension from 3D to 1D for
  each module, which allows efficient learning of system parameters using linear regression.
  As a side benefit, the regression parameters correspond to physical quantities,
  such as spring stiffness or the mass of the rod, making the pipeline explainable.
  The approach significantly reduces the amount of training data required, and also
  avoids iterative identification of data sampling and model training. We compare
  the performance of the proposed engine with previous solutions, and demonstrate
  its efficacy on tensegrity systems, such as NASAâ€™s icosahedron.
