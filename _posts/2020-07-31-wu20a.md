title: Bayesian Learning with Adaptive Load Allocation Strategies
abstract: 'We study a Bayesian learning dynamics induced by agents who repeatedly
  allocate loads on a set of resources based on their belief of an unknown parameter
  that affects the cost distributions of resources. In each step, belief update is
  performed according to Bayes’ rule using the agents’ current load and a realization
  of costs on resources that they utilized. Then, agents choose a new load using an
  adaptive strategy update rule that accounts for their preferred allocation based
  on the updated belief. We prove that beliefs and loads generated by this learning
  dynamics converge almost surely. The convergent belief accurately estimates cost
  distributions of resources that are utilized by the convergent load. We establish
  conditions on the initial load and strategy updates under which the cost estimation
  is accurate on all resources. These results apply to Bayesian learning in congestion
  games with unknown latency functions. Particularly, we provide conditions under
  which the load converges to an equilibrium or socially optimal load with complete
  information of cost parameter. We also design an adaptive tolling mechanism that
  eventually induces the socially optimal outcome. '
