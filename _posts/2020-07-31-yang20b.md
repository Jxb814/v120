title: 'Plan2Vec: Unsupervised Representation Learning by Latent Plans'
abstract: In this paper, we introducePlan2Vec, an model-based method to learn state
  representation fromsequences of off-policy observation data via planning. In contrast
  to prior methods, plan2vec doesnot require grounding via expert trajectories or
  actions, opening it up to many unsupervised learningscenarios. When applied to control,
  plan2vec learns a representation that amortizes the planningcost, enabling test
  time planning complexity that is linear in planning depth rather than exhaustiveover
  the entire state space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Plan2Vec on one simulated
  andtwo real-world image datasets, showing that Plan2Vec can effectively acquire
  representations thatcarry long-range structure to accelerate planning. Additional
