title: Online Data Poisoning Attacks
abstract: We study data poisoning attacks in the online learning setting, where training
  data arrive sequentially, and the attacker is eavesdropping the data stream and
  has the ability to contaminate the current data point to affect the online learning
  process. We formulate the optimal online attack problem as a stochastic optimal
  control problem, and provide a systematic solution using tools from model predictive
  control and deep reinforcement learning. We further provide theoretical analysis
  on the regret suffered by the attacker for not knowing the true data sequence. Experiments
  validate our control approach in generating near-optimal attacks on both supervised
  and unsupervised learning tasks.
