title: A Kernel Mean Embedding Approach to Reducing Conservativeness in Stochastic
  Programming and Control
abstract: 'In this paper, we apply kernel mean embedding methods to sample-based stochastic
  optimization and control. Specifically, we use the reduced-set expansion method
  as a way to discard sampled scenarios. The effect of such constraint removal is
  improved optimality and decreased conservativeness. This is achieved by solving
  a distributional-distance-regularized optimization problem. We demonstrated this
  optimization formulation is well-motivated in theory, computationally tractable,
  and effective in numerical algorithms. '
